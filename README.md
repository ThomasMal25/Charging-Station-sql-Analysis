In this analysis got the data and exercise from DataCamp.
Worked on this in the DataCamp sql envrioment where the data was already loaded in for me.


Write three SQL queries to answer the following questions:

Find the number of unique individuals that use each garageâ€™s shared charging stations. The output should contain two columns: garage_id and num_unique_users. Sort your results by the number of unique users from highest to lowest. Save the result as unique_users_per_garage.

Find the top 10 most popular charging start times (by weekday and start hour) for sessions that use shared charging stations. Your result should contain three columns: weekdays_plugin, start_plugin_hour, and a column named num_charging_sessions containing the number of plugins on that weekday at that hour. Sort your results from the most to the least number of sessions. Save the result as most_popular_shared_start_times.

Find the users whose average charging duration last longer than 10 hours when using shared charging stations. Your result should contain two columns: user_id and avg_charging_duration. Sort your result from highest to lowest average charging duration. Save the result as long_duration_shared_users.
